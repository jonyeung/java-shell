What did I do last time?
	- Added the manual entry for the "!" command
	- Added methods to history.java to help with implementing the "!" command
	- Finished writing the "!" command, including all exceptions, and implemented it into the JShell. 
	- Discussed what tasks needed to be done with the group and who's doing what task.

What do I plan to do now?
	- Work on tasks that I did not complete (handling exceptions with Cat)
	- Work on getting lines from a file for the grep command

Am I stuck on anything?
	- No.

What did I do last time?
	- Started working on exceptions, implemented two of them.
	- Worked on JShell, incorporated Mkdir, Ls, Cd, Pwd.
	- Incorporated the fileSystem to JShell to allow other commands to be 
tested.
	- Made minor changes to how the JShell handles command names, added flexibility to the case sensitivity of command names (user inputted command names are case insensitive).

What do I plan to do now?
	- Continue incorporating commands to the JShell.
	- Test the implementation of all commands by writing Unit tests for them.
	- Write exceptions for classes where needed.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- No.

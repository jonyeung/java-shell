What did I do last time?
	- Discussed ideas with group on how to handle user input exceptions
	- Worked with group to formulate the product backlog, and committed it
	- Brainstormed design ideas with group, recommended utilizing a Stack for the History class as a Stack would be utilized for other commands too (Pushd, Popd)

What do I plan to do now?
	- Start writing the Man class (Incorporate at least half of the commands)
	- Work on effectively implementing each command to the JShell as they are completed
	- Meet up with team members tomorrow to discuss what we've done so far and what we have yet to do
	- Start working on incorporating the list command to the JShell

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not as of yet

What did I do last time?
	- Fixed bugs in mkdir and cd with the help of Jason.
	- Removed a lot of duplicated code in the classes that threw exceptions (unnecessary try catch statements).
	- Started unit testing (PWD).

What do I plan to do now? 
	- Finish working on the unit tests I've been assigned.
	- Reformat any code as necessary.
	- Work with group on fixing bugs to complete the assignment.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Nope.

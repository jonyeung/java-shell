What did I do last time?
	- Implemented exceptions for commands (mkdir, history, man)
	- Worked on JShell, reformatted some code
	- Modified Man.java, took feedback from Brian on the small errors to fix

What do I plan to do now?
	- Work with the team in finding bugs in our current code
	- Implement exceptions where needed
	- Start unit testing

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Need final few commands to be completed so I can implement their exceptions and finish up the commands as soon as possible.
